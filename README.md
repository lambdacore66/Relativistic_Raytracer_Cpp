# Relativistic Raytracer in C/C++ with Python/imageio video renderer

This needs to be written yet ;)

Compile code with:

                   g++ main.cpp -O3 -o main -static-libstdc++ -fopenmp

- Do not use -O3 if you want no compiletor optimizations.
- Do not use -fopenmp if you want no multithread support.

Remain seated while I work on it.
